    "#### What is the overarching purpose of your research project, and why is it an important undertaking?\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching purpose of our research project is to predict if a professional competitive DotA 2 team can win from what characters they pick and ban in a match. \n",
    "\n",
    "Esports, or electronic sports, is a [fast growing business that has reached 1 billion dollar revenue mark](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/newzoo-global-esports-economy-will-top-1-billion-for-the-first-time-in-2019/). \n",
    "\n",
    "With some esports players earning [millions of dollars from tournaments](https://www.esportsearnings.com/) and sponsorships reaching $460 million, the stakes for each game are very high. If our research can find a model that can predict if a team can win based on picks alone, it has a chance to be adopted and used by the developers to help balance the game, which benefits esports enthusiasts in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "We picked DotA 2 dataset as it has the highest prize pool tournament, which is $25 million from The International 2018, and specifically the 2017 to 2018 DotA Pro Circuit games. The reason why we picked professional games to do analysis on is because the professional games are played on Captains Mode where each team picks and bans characters they will play in the match. \n",
    "\n",
    "DotA 2 on Captains Mode is a game of 5 versus 5 where each team alternates banning and picking a character from a pool of 116 characters until there are 6 bans and 5 picks per team. The goal of each team is to destroy the opponent’s stronghold building called Ancient, hence the name Defense of the Ancients. The metagame that forms around picking and banning results in a phenomena called “draft win” in certain matches where a team has a very high chance of winning, assuming no major difference in skills between the two teams, solely on the fact that they picked the right combination of characters versus their opponent. We feel that drafting in DotA 2 provides a unique opportunity to perform data analysis."

    "#### How does your research fit into the broader problem domain?\n",
    "\n",
    "DotA 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, which is a subgenre of a the larger Real-Time Strategy game genre. MOBA games are generally under researched despite having an enthusiastic fan base. Within MOBA games, DotA 2 is oftentimes overshadowed by League of Legends, a more well-known MOBA game. Generally the research that does exist around MOBA games is focused on the user, specifically topics like user intelligence, user visual attention span, and self vs team focus. However, our research is focused the outcome of the game and the relationship between factors within the game and relate to the outcome of the game, rather than the user. \n",

    "Our final web resource will be a HTML Page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is very large so importing and cleaning the data efficiently early on will be very important. The dataset is also has a nested structure that we will have to be careful with.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Some technical skills include: \n",
    "Dealing with Json file in pandas \n",
    "Delve deeper into how Machine learning works \n",
    "Definitely learn the in and outs of formatting data for machine learning specifically using Decision tree Modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How will you conduct you analysis? Please include a detailed description of your intended modeling approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we will read in our data and drop all the columns we don’t want. Next we will split all the data up by major Patch. Then for each Patch dataset we will check to see if any characters are “broken” or  “useless” meaning they dominate no matter the opponent or always lose. We will also want to find out if “good” vs “bad” bans matter for winning. To do both of these things we will run correlation analysis between every character (or character ban) and winning a match. Knowing which characters are more geared to winning will help us validate the accuracy of our model, ideally the game is fairly balanced and it comes down to team composition and not individual characters. Our actual predictive modeling will be done using characters picked as features in Decision tree modeling to predict the outcome of the match. Note this will be done per Major Patch as patches can greatly influence character strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What major challenges do you anticipate? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because all of these matches are professional matches there should not be any “bad picks” or glaring mistakes that make it easier to decide the outcome. Accounting for what characters are on the other team may also prove difficult, as we cannot make individual comparisons but rather individual + team comparisons. The decision of if banned characters should be included in the model is also something we will have to deal with. Is there indeed a correlation to winning if you ban good characters? Or do bans not matter for our model since who is actually playing is all that matters? Another issue that may occur is if there were not many games played during a specific major patch it may lead to inaccurate results. \n"
